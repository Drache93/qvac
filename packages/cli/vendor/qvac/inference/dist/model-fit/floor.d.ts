 * buffers, a completion's working peak — is non-negative, so a floor with all of
 * them at zero is unconditionally valid on any platform and any backend. It can
 * therefore refuse a model (`likely-too-large` when even the floor is over
 * budget) but never confirm one, since how far above the floor the real load
 * lands is unmeasured here.
 *
 * This is the zero-fetch gate. It reads nothing but the catalog and stays the
 * fallback wherever no engine measurement is available.
